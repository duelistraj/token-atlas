# Phase 1 — Initialize OKF Knowledge Base

## Purpose

Initialize the Project Knowledge Framework (PKF) by creating a repository-specific, Open Knowledge Format (OKF) compatible knowledge base.

This phase creates the knowledge structure only. Do **not** extract implementation details.

---

## Inputs

- Current repository
- PKF templates

---

## Outputs

Create or update:

```text
.ai/
├── PKF.md
├── MEMORY.md
├── ARCHITECTURE.md
└── knowledge/
    ├── INDEX.md
    ├── glossary.md
    ├── dependencies.md
    ├── decision_log.md
    └── <module>/
        ├── INDEX.md
        ├── api.md
        ├── schema.md
        ├── business_rules.md
        └── ui.md
```

All documents under `.ai/` must follow the Open Knowledge Format (OKF).

---

## Execution

### 1. Discover Repository

Detect:

- Project name
- Technologies
- Repository structure
- Functional modules

Create knowledge only for modules that exist.

---

### 2. Initialize PKF Runtime

Create or update:

- `PKF.md`
- `MEMORY.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`

These documents define the repository-specific PKF runtime and may evolve as the project evolves.

---

### 3. Create OKF Knowledge Base

Create:

- `knowledge/INDEX.md`
- `glossary.md`
- `dependencies.md`
- `decision_log.md`

Create one directory for every detected module.

---

### 4. Generate Module Skeletons

For every detected module create:

- `INDEX.md`
- `api.md`
- `schema.md`
- `business_rules.md`
- `ui.md`

Populate only:

- OKF metadata
- Document purpose
- Placeholders

Do **not** analyze implementation.

---

### 5. Initialize OKF Metadata

Every generated document must contain valid OKF front matter.

Required fields:

```yaml
---
type:
title:
description:
resource:
tags:
timestamp:

pkf:
  loads: []
  related: []
---
```

Populate only values verifiable from the repository structure.

Leave unknown values empty or marked as `TODO`.

---

### 6. Build Root Knowledge Index

Generate `knowledge/INDEX.md`.

It must contain:

- Project overview
- Technologies
- Available modules
- Module summaries
- Routing keywords
- Module entry points

This is the root entry point into the OKF knowledge base.

---

### 7. Configure PKF Runtime

Update `PKF.md` so every AI session follows this startup sequence:

```text
MEMORY.md
    ↓
ARCHITECTURE.md
    ↓
knowledge/INDEX.md
```

---

## Rules

- Source code is the single source of truth.
- Generate an OKF-compatible knowledge base.
- PKF runtime documents are repository-specific and may evolve.
- Never invent implementation details.
- Never inspect APIs, schemas, or business logic.
- Preserve existing documentation whenever possible.
- Update existing files instead of recreating them.
- Keep the process idempotent.

---

## Completion Criteria

Phase 1 succeeds when:

- The PKF runtime has been initialized.
- The OKF knowledge base exists.
- Every detected module has an OKF skeleton.
- Every document contains valid OKF metadata.
- `knowledge/INDEX.md` routes to every module.
- `PKF.md` routes to the knowledge base.
- No implementation knowledge has been extracted.
- The repository is ready for Phase 2.
